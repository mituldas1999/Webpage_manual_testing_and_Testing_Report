# Webpage_manual_testing_and_Testing_Report

When it comes to writing test cases for a webpage, there are several aspects you should consider. Here's a general outline to help you get started:

Test Case Title/ID: Assign a unique identifier to the test case for easy reference.

Test Case Description: Provide a brief description of the test case, including the specific functionality or feature being tested.

Preconditions: Specify any necessary conditions that must be met before executing the test case, such as logging in or navigating to a particular page.

Test Steps: Outline the step-by-step instructions to reproduce the desired behavior. This should include interacting with various elements on the webpage, such as buttons, forms, links, etc. Be as specific and detailed as possible.

Expected Results: Clearly state the expected outcome or behavior after performing each test step. This can include validating the presence of certain elements, verifying the accuracy of displayed information, or confirming the success of specific actions.

Actual Results: Leave this section blank initially. It will be filled in later with the actual observations during test execution.

Test Data: Specify any input data or values required to execute the test case. This can include valid and invalid data, boundary values, or specific test scenarios.

Test Environment: Document the specific browser, operating system, and any other relevant software or hardware configurations necessary to reproduce the test scenario accurately.

Test Priority: Assign a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low) to indicate the importance and urgency of the test case.

Test Status: Initially set the status as "Not Executed." It will be updated during the test execution phase.

Test Pass/Fail Criteria: Define the criteria for determining whether the test case passes or fails. This could be based on the expected results, error messages, system behavior, or any other relevant factors.

Notes: Include any additional notes, observations, or comments related to the test case.
